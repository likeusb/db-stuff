If you want to test the design out, use GitHub's download repo feature to download it as a zip, extract the contents of the zip into one folder, start up the express server with the method described below, and just open up any of the .html files! Ideally, start with index.html, but all the files should have traces to every other file. 
If you use uBlockOrigin, the design will break as uBO is active on files too, so you will need to either temporarily turn it off or manually turn it off on every page.

How to start Express server:
- Open up the directory in your terminal
- Run `npm i`
- Then, run `npm start`
Feel free to open up the website after this.
